      ## Snippets
      The content component can embed inline components called snippets.

      ### Accordion
      <Accordion title="Accordion">
        <p>The accordion snippet creates an expandable region of text.</p>
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Multiple Accordions">
        <p>Placing multiple accordions next to each other can be used to break content into sections.</p>
      </Accordion>

      ### Button
      Important links can be turned into buttons, making them easier to distinguish from normal in-text links.

      <a class="button" href="#">Button</a>

      ### Counter
      The counter can be used to animate numbers in text: <Counter>1234</Counter>

      # <Counter>100km/h</Counter>

      Counters will play their animation when they scroll into view.

      ### Social
      The social snippet can be used to insert social media buttons into content.
      <Social />
